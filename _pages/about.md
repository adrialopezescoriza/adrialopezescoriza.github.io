Hey, I'm Adrià, a final-year Robotics, Systems, and Control MSc student at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ub.edu/web/ub/en/). My current research interests lie at the intersection between robotics, reinforcement learning, and decision making. My long-term goal is to enable long-term reasoning in embodied AI agents so that they can seamlessly interact with their environment. 🤖

## Research Interests

Within deep reinforcement learning, embodied AI, and robotics, I am particularly interested in:

**Hierarchical / Skill-based learning**: enable long-horizon task learning through temporal abstraction and guided exploration.

**Model-based learning**: build internal world models of the embodied self and the world to develop a general understanding and improve sample-efficiency in learning through planning.

**Representation learning**: autonomously infer and discover the underlying temporal, spatial, and causal structures of the input across different modalities for efficient decision-making and generalization.

A sample of other topics that I’m also very curious about: generative models, multi-agent cooperation, life-long learning and learning from human videos.

## Research & Work Experience

### Master Thesis at Visual Intelligence and Systems Lab

🔍 Under the guidance of [Prof. Dr. Fisher Yu](https://www.vis.xyz/), my master thesis focuses on Chain of Thought World Models for Goal Conditioned Reinforcement Learning at the [Visual Intelligence and Systems](https://www.vis.xyz/) lab. Supervised by [Lei Ke](https://www.kelei.site/) and [Yao Mu](https://yaomarkmu.github.io/), exploring novel approaches in reinforcement learning.

### Motion Planning Intern at Motional

At [Motional](https://motional.com/) Singapore, I worked on the design of a new behavioral planning pipeline for the next generation of autonomous vehicles. 🚙

### KalmanNet: Data-Driven Kalman Filtering


## Autonomous Racing & State Estimation 🏎️

### Autonomous Racing at AMZ Driverless
🚗 Engagement with [AMZ Driverless](https://amzracing.ch/en) involved leading the estimation module, designing state-of-the-art Kalman Filters.

### SLAM & Autonomous Racing at BCN eMotorsport
🏎️ Early experiences at [BCN eMotorsport](https://bcnemotorsport.upc.edu/home/) in Barcelona involved studying SLAM algorithms and implementing mapping algorithms in Spanish autonomous cars.

## Teaching and Mentoring

Teaching Assistant for the course Game Theory And Control at ETH Zurich.
Robotics academy: Organizing robotic and programming workshops for students aged from 8 to 14.


## Achievements & Awards 🏆

- 3rd place overall in Formula Student Germany's Driverless category with AMZ Driverless.
- Daimler AI Award for pioneering AI solutions in autonomous driving.
- Maximum grade and honors for my Bachelor's Thesis at UPC.
- 1st place in Mational Mathematics Olympiads of Spain and Andorra.

## Interests & Extracurriculars

Beyond academia, I indulge in various interests and extracurricular activities:

- Alpine skiing, Alpinism, Tennis, and Surfing. 🏂
- Volunteering experiences in teaching robotics and construction projects.
