I'm a final year Robotics, Systems and Control MSc student at the [ETH Zurich](https://www.ub.edu/web/ub/en/)

My research interests are in the field of robotics, reinforcement learning and decision making. My long-term goal is to develop intelligent robots that can learn from their own experience and interact with humans in a natural way.

I'm currently working on my master thesis at the [Visual Intelligence and Systems](https://www.vis.xyz/) lab under the supervision of [Prof. Dr. Fisher Yu](https://www.vis.xyz/). I'm working on the project Chain of Thought World Models for Goal Conditioned Reinforcement Learning fortunately advised by [Lei Ke](https://www.kelei.site/) and [Yao Mu](https://yaomarkmu.github.io/).
