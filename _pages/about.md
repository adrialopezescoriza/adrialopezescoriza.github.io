I am an incoming doctoral student at the [Robotic Systems Lab](https://rsl.ethz.ch/) at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), where I will be supervised by [Prof. Marco Hutter](https://rsl.ethz.ch/the-lab/people/person-detail.html?persid=110601). I have recently spent time as a research intern at [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/) with [Hao Su](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/index.html) and at the [Robotics and AI Institute (RAI)](https://theaiinstitute.com/), working on **humanoid locomotion**.  

Previously, I received an MSc degree in Robotics, Systems & Control from [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), where I was advised by [Roland Siegwart](https://asl.ethz.ch/the-lab/people/person-detail.Mjk5ODE=.TGlzdC8yMDI4LDEyMDExMzk5Mjg=.html). Before that, I obtained my BSc degree in Telecommunications Engineering from [UPC](https://telecos.upc.edu/en?set_language=en).  

Alongside my studies, I spent two years at **AMZ Racing**, where I worked on the autonomy stack of a fully custom self-driving car. I also interned for a semester at **Motional**, focusing on high-level motion planning for autonomous driving.  

Broadly, I am fascinated by the field of robot learning, with a particular focus on developing agents that are both robust and explainable in their decision-making processes. My interest lies in enabling these agents to **learn to reason** rather than simply react, for instance, using world models for data-driven planning. Additionally, I focus on developing simple methods that can efficiently learn from diverse data sources. My overarching research goal is to contribute to the development of general-purpose robots capable of seamlessly performing complex, long-horizon tasks in everyday life.
