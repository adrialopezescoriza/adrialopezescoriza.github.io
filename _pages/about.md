# About Me

Hey, I'm Adri√†, a final-year Robotics, Systems, and Control MSc student at [ETH Zurich](https://www.ub.edu/web/ub/en/). My academic journey has been driven by a deep interest in robotics, reinforcement learning, and decision making. ü§ñ

## Education

üéì I started my academic journey with a Bachelor's in Telecommunications Engineering from the [Universitat Polit√©cnica de Catalunya](https://telecos.upc.edu/en?set_language=en) (UPC) in Barcelona, Spain. Graduated with honors and a GPA of 8.27/10, diving into signal processing, communication systems, and electronic control.

Furthered my skills with an enriching semester at the [Electrical Engineering Department](https://ee.ethz.ch/) of ETH Zurich through the Bachelor Mobility Program.

Currently pursuing a Master's degree in Robotics, Systems & Control at ETH Zurich, exploring captivating courses and research projects. üß†

## Research & Work Experience

My academic journey intertwined with practical experiences that fuel my passion for robotics and autonomous systems:

### Master Thesis at Visual Intelligence and Systems Lab

üîç Under the guidance of [Prof. Dr. Fisher Yu](https://www.vis.xyz/), my master thesis focuses on Chain of Thought World Models for Goal Conditioned Reinforcement Learning at the [Visual Intelligence and Systems](https://www.vis.xyz/) lab. Supervised by [Lei Ke](https://www.kelei.site/) and [Yao Mu](https://yaomarkmu.github.io/), exploring novel approaches in reinforcement learning.

### Motion Planning Intern at Motional

At [Motional](https://motional.com/) in Singapore, I worked on benchmarking planning pipelines and designing new behavioral planning pipelines for autonomous driving systems.

### Autonomous Racing & State Estimation

üöó Engagement with [AMZ Driverless](https://amzracing.ch/en) involved leading the estimation module, designing state-of-the-art Kalman Filters, and contributing to innovative AI solutions for autonomous driving, recognized with accolades such as the Daimler AI Award.

### SLAM & Autonomous Racing at BCN eMotorsport

üèéÔ∏è Early experiences at [BCN eMotorsport](https://bcnemotorsport.upc.edu/home/) in Barcelona involved studying SLAM algorithms and implementing mapping algorithms in Spanish autonomous cars.

## Achievements & Awards

My academic and professional journey has been peppered with achievements:

- Securing 3rd place overall in Formula Student Germany's Driverless category with AMZ Driverless.
- Winning the Daimler AI Award for pioneering AI solutions in autonomous driving.
- Earning maximum grades for my Bachelor's Thesis at UPC.
- Seizing 1st place in national Mathematics Olympiads showcasing problem-solving skills. üèÜ

## Interests & Extracurriculars

Beyond academia, I indulge in various interests and extracurricular activities:

- Alpine skiing, Alpinism, Tennis, and Surfing.
- Volunteering experiences in teaching robotics and construction projects. üèÇ

I'm thrilled to share my journey, experiences, and insights through this platform. Stay tuned for updates and discoveries!
