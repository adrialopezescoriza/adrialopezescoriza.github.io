Hey, I'm Adrià, a final-year Robotics, Systems, and Control MSc student at [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html) supervised by [Roland Sigwart](https://asl.ethz.ch/the-lab/people/person-detail.Mjk5ODE=.TGlzdC8yMDI4LDEyMDExMzk5Mjg=.html) from the [Autonomous Systems Laboratory](https://asl.ethz.ch/). My current research interests lie at the intersection between robotics, reinforcement learning, and decision making. My long-term goal is to enable long-term reasoning in robotic agents so that they can seamlessly interact with their environment. 🤖

## 🌟 Research Interests

Within deep reinforcement learning, embodied AI, and robotics, I am particularly interested in:

**Hierarchical / Skill-based learning**: enable long-horizon task learning through temporal abstraction and guided exploration. Could a robot learn to cook a meal by first learning to use the oven, then the stove, and finally the knife?

**Model-based learning**: build internal world models of the embodied self and the world to develop a general understanding and improve sample-efficiency in learning through planning.

**Representation learning**: autonomously infer and discover the underlying temporal, spatial, and causal structures of the input across different modalities for efficient decision-making and generalization.

A sample of other topics that I’m also very curious about: generative models, multi-agent cooperation, life-long learning and learning from human videos.

## 💼 Research & Work Experience

### Master Thesis at Visual Intelligence and Systems Lab

🔍 Under the guidance of [Prof. Dr. Fisher Yu](https://www.vis.xyz/), my master thesis focuses on Chain of Thought World Models for Goal Conditioned Reinforcement Learning at the [Visual Intelligence and Systems](https://www.vis.xyz/) lab. Supervised by [Lei Ke](https://www.kelei.site/) and [Yao Mu](https://yaomarkmu.github.io/), exploring how temporal abstraction models can help hierarchical RL agents to succeed in long-horizon complex manipulation tasks.

### Motion Planning Research Intern at Motional

At [Motional](https://motional.com/) Singapore, I worked on the design of a new behavioral planning pipeline for the next generation of autonomous vehicles. 🚙 

Guided by [Hans Andersen](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=ODZqlM8AAAAJ&hl=en), we prototyped, implemented and tested a new behavioral planning pipeline. This pipeline was specifically designed to handle complex scenarios with a large number of agents on the road and perform advanced maneuvers, such as overtaking multiple cars.

### State Estimation: KalmanNet

In this project, we presented KalmanNet, a real-time state estimator that learns from data to perform Kalman filtering under non-linear dynamics with partial information. By incorporating the structural State Space model with a dedicated recurrent neural network module in the flow of a Kalman Filter, we managed to retain data efficiency and interpretability of the
classic algorithm while implicitly learning complex dynamics from data.

## 🏎️ Autonomous Racing & State Estimation 

### Autonomous Racing at AMZ Driverless
During my undergraduate exchange at ETH I was part of the Formula Student Driverless team, [AMZ Driverless](https://amzracing.ch/en). As a
team, we built autonomous racing cars from scratch that later competed at the international Formula Student competitions. I was in charge of the state estimation system of the car and also of the electronics of the autonomous system. AMZ Racing holds the [world record](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88cVs5zZFTE) for the fastest acceleration in an electric vehicle. In 2021 I assumed the leadership of the estimation team, supervising the mapping and estimation algorithms.

### SLAM & Autonomous Racing at BCN eMotorsport
As a part of the [BCN eMotorsport](https://bcnemotorsport.upc.edu/home/), I was part of the design, construction, and testing of
the first autonomous racing car ever in Spain. My job was to design an online SLAM algorithm to extract a track map from LiDAR observations and raw GPS data. Along with my teammates, we made it to the international Formula Student Germany competition, where the car managed to complete some of the events, being the first-ever Spanish university team to achieve so.

## 🎓 Teaching and Mentoring 

**Teaching Assistant** for the course Game Theory And Control at ETH Zurich: During my Master's degree I was working as a part-time teaching assistant helping to prepare lectures and correct assignments for the course.

**Robotics academy**: As a side job during my undergraduate program I had the pleasure of working as an after-school robotics teacher for children interested in learning basic robotics and programming. I was in charge of designing robotic and programming workshops for students aged from 8 to 14 during holidays and after-school hours.


## 🏆 Achievements & Awards 

- 3rd place overall in Formula Student Germany's Driverless category with AMZ Driverless.
- Daimler AI Award for pioneering AI solutions in autonomous driving.
- Maximum grade and honors for my Bachelor's Thesis at UPC.
- 1st place in Mational Mathematics Olympiads of Spain and Andorra.

## 🏄‍♂️ Other Interests  
I enjoy:
- Alpine Skiing, Alpinism, Tennis, and Surfing. 🏂
- Backpacking and traveling for 6 months in South America and Asia. 🌎
- Volunteering experiences in teaching robotics and construction projects. 🏗️
- Reading, discussing about the future of the world and learning about other topics. 📚
