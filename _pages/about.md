I am currently a research intern in robot learning at [UCSD](https://ucsd.edu/) under the supervision of [Hao Su](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haosu/index.html). Previously, I received an MS degree in Robotics from [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html), where I was advised by [Roland Siegwart](https://asl.ethz.ch/the-lab/people/person-detail.Mjk5ODE=.TGlzdC8yMDI4LDEyMDExMzk5Mjg=.html). Before that, I obtained my BS degree in Telecommunications Engineering from [UPC](https://telecos.upc.edu/en?set_language=en).

Alongside my studies, I spent two years at **AMZ Racing**, where I worked on the autonomy stack of a fully custom self-driving car. I also interned for a semester at **Motional**, focusing on high-level motion planning for autonomous driving.

I am fascinated by the field of robot learning, with a particular focus on developing agents that are both robust and explainable in their decision-making processes. My interest lies in enabling these agents to **learn to reason** rather than simply react, for instance, using world models for data-driven planning. Additionally, I focus on developing simple methods that can efficiently learn from diverse data sources. My overarching research goal is to contribute to the development of general-purpose robots capable of seamlessly performing complex, long-horizon tasks in everyday life.
